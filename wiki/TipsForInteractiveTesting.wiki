Many of the modern desktop web browsers enable users to specify a custom css stylesheet See http://www.squarefree.com/userstyles/user-style-sheets.html for a dated, but useful, overview of how to add stylesheets to Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera.

== Firefox ==
An example userContent.css is available on this site at http://code.google.com/p/web-accessibility-testing/source/browse/trunk/assets/userContent.css The key setting is the one that tracks the current element selected by the keyboard. The relevant code fragment is:
{{{ 
:focus {
background-color: green ! important;
}
}}}

Note: this code can also be injected into an arbitrary web page using Firebug (one of my favourite Add-ons for Firefox).
